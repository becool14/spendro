# Spendro MERN Application

This project is a MERN stack application consisting of a `frontend` (React), `backend` (Node.js + Express), and MongoDB (database). The application is containerized using Docker for easier deployment.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have:

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (already included with Docker Desktop)

> **Note:** Ensure that Docker is running in **Linux Containers** mode (if you are on Windows).

```

## Create `.env` Files

Make sure to create `.env` files in the `backend` and `frontend` directories. You can use the `.env.example` files as templates to create the corresponding `.env` files.

For `backend/.env`:

```
MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017/spendrodb
PORT=5000
```

For `frontend/.env`:

```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

## Start Docker Compose to Build and Run Containers

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will build images for the backend, frontend, and MongoDB, and run them in containers.

Open your browser and check the application:

- The frontend (React) will be available at: http://localhost:3000
- The backend (Node.js/Express) will run on port 5000 but can be accessed through the frontend.

## Stopping Containers

To stop the containers, press Ctrl + C in the terminal where Docker Compose is running, or use the command:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

If you added new dependencies or made changes to the Dockerfile, restart with `--build`:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## Basic Docker Commands

- Start containers: `docker-compose up`
- Start containers with rebuild: `docker-compose up --build`
- Stop containers: `docker-compose down`
- View running containers: `docker ps`
- Check logs: `docker-compose logs -f <service_name>`
  - For example: `docker-compose logs -f backend` to view backend logs.

## Troubleshooting

### "Address already in use" Error

If you see an error like `EADDRINUSE`, it means the port is already in use. Make sure other services are not using ports 5000 or 3000.

### MongoDB Connection Error

Ensure that the environment variable `MONGO_URI` points to the correct host (in our case, it's `mongo`, as that's the name of the service in `docker-compose.yml`).

### Changes Not Applying After Code Edit

If you make changes to the code, they should be automatically recognized due to volumes. If changes are not applying, check the settings in `docker-compose.yml`.

## Additional Information

### Explanation of `README.md`

1. **Description**: The documentation explains what the project is and which technologies it uses.
2. **Requirements**: Users must have Docker and Docker Compose, which are already included in Docker Desktop.
3. **Setup and Run**: Detailed steps for running the project, from cloning the repository to running `docker-compose`.
4. **Docker Commands**: Useful commands for stopping, starting, and checking containers.
5. **Troubleshooting**: Common errors and ways to resolve them, enabling team members to address issues independently.

This will help your colleague quickly set up the project and resolve most potential problems without additional questions.
